Purpose

  The project contains some scripts to create an Arch Linux repository:
  scripts are very simple, and based on the official documents
    http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/DeveloperWiki:NewMirrors     [1]

File list

  * rsync.dirs
      Default: pool core extra community
      Directories to be mirrored. See more at
        http://mirror.aarnet.edu.au/pub/archlinux/                   [2]

  * rsync.opts
      Default: -rtlvH --delete-after --delay-updates --safe-links --max-delete=1000
      Options will be passed to rsync command.

  * rsync.urls:
      List of tier-1 repositories (See [1]). The file may contains many
      lines: the ones started by a sharp are comments. The first non-comment
      line which is started by *rsync://* will be sued.

Usage

  * Start the mirroring
      ./sync.sh 1>>sync.sh.log 2>&1 &

  * Get current state:
      ./stat.sh
