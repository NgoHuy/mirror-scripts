mirror-scripts
==============

This repository contains some scripts used
to create `ArchLinux{,ARM}` mirror on the 
`phant6m8` server in Đà Nẵng, Việt Nam.

This repository is not useful for the world.
However, this is the good way that helps our
mirror maintainers to work together for a safer
and a faster world.
